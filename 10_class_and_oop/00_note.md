# Javascript and Classes

## OOP

### Object

- Collection of properties(variables) and methods(functions), e.g. toLowerCase()

### why use OOP - parts of OOP

- Object literal
- Constructor Function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this > part of instances)

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - 4 Pillars

#### 01 Abstraction 
- simplified interface for the outside world while hiding the complexities internally.

### 02 Encapsulation
- bundling of data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class. It hides the internal state of the object and restricts access to some of its components.

### 03 Inheritance
- allows a class (subclass/derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass/base class).

### 04 Polymorphism
- allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. It enables a single interface to represent different types and allows methods to be applied to objects of various types.
